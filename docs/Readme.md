# README: Question -> Data -> Insight in Data Science

## 1. Explaining the Lifecycle
In practice, data science is not a straight line from dataset to dashboard. It is a reasoning cycle:

- Start with a question worth answering.
- Gather and understand data that can act as evidence.
- Explore that evidence until you can produce an insight that supports a decision.

Each step shapes the next one. If the question is vague, data collection becomes random. If data is poorly understood, insights are fragile. If insights are not tied back to the question, analysis becomes interesting but not useful.

## Start with a clear question
A clear question defines the decision context. It tells us:

- Who needs the answer
- What action might change based on the answer
- What success looks like

For example, "How can we improve employee experience in the next quarter?" is clearer than "Analyze employee sentiment." The first version points to a timeline, an audience, and possible interventions. The second only asks for description.

This is critical because the question sets boundaries. It prevents us from collecting irrelevant data and over-analyzing metrics that do not affect real decisions.

## Data is evidence, not just a file
After defining the question, data becomes the evidence we use to test explanations. But before any modeling or charting, we need to understand what the data actually means.

Understanding data includes:

- Source: where it came from and how it was collected
- Structure: what each field represents and at what level (employee-level, department-level, monthly summary, etc.)
- Quality: missing values, duplicates, inconsistent labels, sampling bias, timing issues
- Relevance: whether this data can truly answer the question

This step matters because analysis quality is limited by evidence quality. Clean plots cannot fix misaligned or biased data.

## Insights emerge from exploration
Insights are not automatic outputs from tools. They emerge when patterns are interpreted in context.

An exploration might show that negative sentiment spikes in two departments. That is a finding. It becomes an insight only when we connect it to operational reality, such as workload peaks, manager turnover, or policy changes during the same period.

Useful insights have three properties:

- They answer the original question
- They explain "why this matters"
- They suggest a decision or next action

So the lifecycle is connected: question focuses the evidence, evidence supports exploration, and exploration produces actionable insight.
